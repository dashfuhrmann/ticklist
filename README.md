Ticklist offers customers who regulary climb at the Kletterzentrum VerticalWorld Kassel to track their progress, visualise that progress, compare themselves to others and check their current standing in the overall leaderboard.

In the future I want the site to be used as a form of community where climbers upload videos of their achievements, share beta and ideas and to have a way to track and review their longterm progress through insightful charts and analytics. Furthermore I want to integrate challenges and achievements into the webside to create a more dynamic and interactive user experience.

Libraries, Plugins, Frameworks:
Firebase/Firestore
React
Redux
Bootstrap
Fontawesome
ChartJS
CircularProgressBar

Next version features and improvements:

- Show an alert when the user wants to log a boulder, show a confirm button and the current form values 
- Show the users leaderboard position in their profile (Completed)
- Edit  profile functionality with profile picture upload to Firebase Cloud Storage
- New tap in the users profile where they can view a list of all completed boulders and how they ranked the boulders
- Lifetime statistics once an new set of problems is released, more statistics in general
- Video upload for each boulder with a Bootstrap modal to view all uploaded videos of that boulder
- Visual improvements of all components, a photo for each climbing wall
- Sidebar with news (new boulderset releases, new features, challenges etc.)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
